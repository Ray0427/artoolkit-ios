About this archive.
------------------- 

This archive contains the ARToolKit libraries, utilities and examples for iOS, version 5.2.

ARToolKit version 5.2 is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3, with some additional permissions. Example code is generally released under a more permissive disclaimer; please read the file LICENSE.txt for more information.

If you intend to publish your app on Apple's iOS App Store, you must use your own package name, and not the org.artoolkit package name.

ARToolKit is designed to build on Windows, Macintosh OS X, Linux, iOS and Android platforms.

Requirements.
-------------

Requirements:
 * Xcode tools v5.0.1 or later and iOS SDK v7.0 or later, running on Mac OS X 10.8 or later.
 * These devices are supported: iPhone: 3GS, 4, 4s, 5, 5c, 5s. iPad: 2, 3, Mini, 4, Mini 2, Air. iPod touch: 4th Generation, 5th Generation. The device must be running iOS 5.1.1 or later. The iPhone 3GS is not supported for NFT use.
 * Paid membership of Apple's iOS Developer Program.
 * A valid iOS Developer Certificate issued by Apple.
 * A printer to print the pattern PDF images "Hiro pattern", "Kanji pattern", "Sample1 pattern", "Sample2 pattern", and "pinball.jpg".


Installing.
-----------

ARToolKit is supplied as pre-built binaries for each platform, plus full source code for the SDK libraries, utilities, and examples, and documentation. If you wish to view the source for the desktop-only utilities, you will also need to use this iOS release alongside ARToolKit v5.x for Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux.

The SDK is supplied as an archive file (.tar.gz or .zip file) which need only be unpacked to a location of your choice, e.g. ~/SDKs/. Drop the archive into your chosen location and double-click it in the Finder to unpack it.


Getting started.
----------------

The ARToolKit5.xcodeproj file contains six examples of using ARToolKit in an iOS application.
 * ARAppES1 shows only the most basic usage, which is to track the Hiro marker and draw a colorcube on the marker.
 * ARApp is identical in functionality to ARAppES1, but uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
 * ARApp2 shows additional techniques of loading Wavefront .obj models, including textures, from disk, and tracking and drawing on more than one marker. It also includes the required code to perform basic finger-tap interaction with the virtual environment, although this is not currently used in the application.
 * ARAppOSG extends the ARApp2 example with loading of models using OpenSceneGraph (.osg and .ive formats) including animation, effects, lighting and more.
 * ARAppMovie extends the ARApp2 example with loading and playback of movie file in the 3D virtual environment.
 * ARAppNFT shows basic NFT usage, which is to track the "pinball.jpg" image and draw a model (using the Eden Library WaveFront .obj renderer) on the image.
 * ARAppNFTOSG shows basic NFT usage, which is to track the "pinball.jpg" image and draw OpenSceneGraph-based models (using the OSG libraries) on the image.

See the http://www.artoolworks.org/documentation/About_the_ARApp_app_design in the online documentation for more information on the design of these apps.

With an appropriate iOS Team Provisioning Profile generated by Xcode, the applications should be able to be built and run directly from the SDK. If however you are basing your own applications on the sample code, you will need to edit the bundle IDs and set up an appropriate provisioning profile for your new bundle ID. I.e. edit the files ARApp*-Info.plist, replacing "com.artoolworks.${PRODUCT_NAME:identifier}" with your Bundle ID. See https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html for more info.

ARToolKit cannot be used on the iOS simulator. If you've never done any iOS development before, you will benefit by first getting some experience with Apple's SDK and examples so that you're familiar with building and running an iOS app on an actual device.


Training new markers.
---------------------

The utilities required to train new square and NFT markers are provide in the "bin" directory of the SDK. The utilities are command-line OS X executables which should be run from a Terminal environment.

Consult the ARToolKit documentation for more information:
    http://www.artoolkit.org/documentation/Creating_and_training_new_ARToolKit_markers
    http://www.artoolkit.org/documentation/ARToolKit_NFT

Usage:
    ./mk_patt
	./genTexData somejpegfile.jpg
	./dispImageSet somejpegfile.jpg
	./dispFeatureSet somejpegfile.jpg
	./checkResolution Data/camera_para.dat (change camera_para.dat to the correct camera calibration file for your device, camera and resolution).


Release notes.
--------------
This release contains ARToolKit v5.2 for iOS.

Please see the ChangeLog.txt for details of changes in this and earlier releases.

ARToolKit v5.2 is the first major release under an open source license in several years, and represents several years of commercial development of ARToolKit by ARToolworks during this time. It will appear to be a significant change to previous users of ARToolKit v2.x. Please see http://www.artoolkit.org/documentation/ARToolKit_feature_comparison for more information.

For users of ARToolKit Professional versions 4.0 through 5.1.7, ARToolKit v5.2 includes a number of changes. Significantly, full source is now provided for the NFT libraries libAR2 and libKPM.

--
ARToolKit v5.0.8 and later include optimised support for iPhone 5s and later devices with 64-bit CPUs. To support this change, the SDK must be used with Xcode 5.0.1 or later. Devices running iOS 5.1.1 and later are supported, which allows for the same supported device set as earlier releases. (Xcode 5.0 restricted support to devices running iOS 6.0 and later, but this was relaxed in Xcode 5.0.1 to devices running iOS 5.1.1 and later.)

For help with integrating changes in this version of ARToolKit with your own iOS app code, please see http://www.artoolkit.org/documentation/Updating_an_AR_application_with_the_latest_ARToolKit_for_iOS_example_code


libKPM usage.
-------------

libKPM, which performs key-point matching for NFT page recognition and initialization depends on the patented SURF algorithm. Previously, this was used under a commercial license from the owners of the SURF patent. Since this license is no longer appropriate for a free and open-source release, we are actively working on replacing SURF in libKPM. We expect to complete this change by the end of June 2015. In the meantime, users are free to use libKPM including SURF under the terms set out in the KPM header and source files. We recommend against deploying products including libKPM until an updated free and open source version is made available. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Existing holders of a commercial license to ARToolKit Professional v5.x may use libKPM from ARToolKit v5.2 under the terms of their current license for the remainder of its duration. Please contact us via http://www.artoolkit.org/contact if you are an existing user of ARToolKit Professional with questions.
